# Stenocadabra

Live display of steno strokes with translations.

## Vision

- This tool was made for the purpose of making steno video demonstrations.
- Future plans include making this a game where you try to find all the combinations and words.
- Maybe even visualize a web of words that are connected by how they are stroked. For example, words that are one stroke apart are connected by a line.
